# ftpquickdelete
This little script allows you to quickly remove entire directories from your server - without having to wait on FTP.


Simply upload it to the same directory as the folder you'd like to delete, and then navigate to the script: http://www.mysite.com/deleter.php.

Then copy & paste the name of the directory you'd like to remove into the form field then click "submit".

Wiat a second or two and viola! You've just saved hours of FTP deleting time.

You can thank me later. :)
